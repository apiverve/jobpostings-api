# [Job Postings API](https://apiverve.com/marketplace/jobpostings?utm_source&#x3D;github&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;referral&amp;utm_content&#x3D;readme)

Job Postings is a jobs API that returns the open positions on a company&#x27;s public career board. Every job comes back in the same shape: title, department, team, locations, remote and workplace type, employment type, posting date and apply link. Filter by keyword, location, department, employment type, posting date or remote. Paid plans add the full job description and salary ranges where the company publishes them.

The Job Postings API provides a simple, reliable way to integrate job postings functionality into your applications. Built for developers who need production-ready job postings capabilities without the complexity of building from scratch.
